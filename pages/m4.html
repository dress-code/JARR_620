        <h2>Process Overview</h2>
	    <p>Team members met and discussed what set of features that were musts for a design that satisfied the needs and desires of our personas, but not 
		how to implement them. Members were given a few days to come up with their own lo-fi designs for the application, implementing the key features as they saw fit.
		Once done, the team met again and showcased what each member had created. Respectful and edifying discussion was had surrounding various aspects of the designs, noting both good and bad elements.
		The team selected items they liked from all of the designs and combined them into the lo-fi prototype iteration shown on this page. </p>
