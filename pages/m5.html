        <h2>Process Overview</h2>
	    <p>Team members met and discussed the set of features which were musts for a design that satisfied the needs and desires of our personas, but not 
		how to implement them. Members were given a few days to come up with their own takes on the lo-fi designs for the application, implementing the key features as they saw fit.
		Once done, the team met again and showcased what each member had created. Respectful and edifying discussion was had surrounding various aspects of the designs, noting both desirable and undesirable elements.
		The team selected items they liked from all of the designs and combined them into the lo-fi prototype iteration shown on this page. </p>

		<p>This lo-fi iteration is broken up into workflows to help alleviate the tangled webs of arrows showing connections between screens
		that can occur. Our work can be found in <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/freehand/document/xHYtKErNx">our InVision Freehand document.</a></p>
	    
		<p>At this stage in the project, the team decided on the name <strong>Achord</strong> for our application. "Accord" is defined as harmony between people or views,
		something we desire in positive social media interactions. "Chord" is a musical concept of individual notes coming together to make sound with more depth.
		Intertwined together as "Achord", we believe these words evoke the meaningful social media music experience we seek to create.</p>
