        <h2>Design Process Overview</h2>
	    <p>The team collaborated on Figma to create a hi-fi prototype idea for what Achord could look and function like. First, insight and creativity
		was sought from other designers and designs and placed on an inspiration board. Second, a style guide was created
		for the team designers to follow, which contained icons, fonts, and a color palette. Third, designers checked in on Zoom to perform 
		edifying critique of each other's work. When meetings were not feasible, comments were left on the Figma project itself for other team members to review.
		 This prototype is not perfect, but it does get the idea across. While there are some similarities between the prototype and our lo-fi version, we did rethink 
		how many of our features would work and appear. With more time and a full team able to help, we plan to polish this design in the future. For now, we look 
		forward to testing what we have with our user base and editing anything that needs to be changed based on their experience. Below, you will find a video walkthrough of the application and the link to the Figma design project.</p>
