        <h2>Contextual Inquiry Process</h2>
	    <p>Team members worked together to craft a semi-structured interview guide containing questions 
about social media and music consumption experiences and habits. Using this guide, each member of the 
group interviewed two or three participants for a total of ten interviews. Participants generally belonged to the 
social circles of the interviewers, as this made sense in a COVID-affected world. Once an interview was scheduled,
a follow up Zoom invitation or reminder was sent to the participant on the day of the appointment. Interviews were 
audio-recorded with the permission of the interviewee. Participant demographics are shown 
below. The data gleaned from this process was then parsed and categorized into an informative affinity 
map, which will guide the design process as we seek to keep user needs and desires at the forefront of our minds.

          - Would you be interested in connecting with new people with similar music tastes as you? Or just with friends you already know?
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>We also gave our participants a few scenarios to gauge their interest in some potential features.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Scenario 1</dt>
      <dd>You are at a coffee shop listening to the music on your phone on an application that fosters music sharing. 
There is a cute person across the room, but they have headphones on. You can see on the app that they are listening 
to a song from a genre you like. After a little while, you get a notification that someone has a song suggestion for 
you. You open it up to see the cute person’s profile picture next to the title of a song. You can accept or decline it.
In this case, you accept. After listening to the song, a chat window appears for you to optionally start a conversation 
or give feedback about their suggestion. Assuming you have the ability to turn this feature on and off, would you or any 
of your friends enjoy sharing music in this way? Why or why not?</dd>
	    
      <dt>Scenario 2</dt>
	    <dd>You and your friends or loved ones are separated during an internship over the summer. You all enjoy 
listening to and sharing music, but given the distance between you, it seems difficult. You open a music app on your 
phone and start a “studio” room that your friends can join from the applications on their phones if they are online. 
Once the room is joined, you can all work together to curate a playlist, listen to music, and chat simultaneously.
Do you think that you or anyone you know would enjoy using a feature like that? Why or why not?</dd>
		   
      <dt>Scenario 3</dt>
	    <dd>You are unable to physically be with a friend/loved one, but you both enjoy listening to the same type 
of music. You open a music app on your phone and see that the other person is offline. You send them song suggestions 
you think they would like for them to listen to when they return.
Do you think that you or anyone you know would enjoy using a feature like that? Why or why not?</dd>

    <h2>Affinity Diagram</h2>
	<p>Together, we created an affinity diagram using Figma, an online collaborative design tool. Below is just a portion of the 
information we sorted out, showing some of the interesting insights gleaned from the contextual inquiry process. In addition to the 
sorted sticky notes, over 200 comments were left on the Figma document with direct quotes from the interviews and insights about participants.</p>

<!-- Conclusion Section -->
<section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>At the end of our contextual inquiry, we found some key insights that will guide our process going forward.
	Overwhelmingly, participants expressed a stark difference of opinion between social media interactions and social interactions 
	involving music. While social media was described with such words as “disingenuous”, “negative”, “stressful”, and “pressuring”, 
	social interactions involving music were referred to as “heartfelt”, “wholesome”, “chill”, and “bonding”. We believe that we can 
	leverage this information to create a delightful application that encourages the best aspects of human interaction instead of channeling the worst. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Additionally, we found that most users can fluctuate between two camps when it comes to sharing music. There are active sharers who enjoy 
and seek out real-time social interactions based on music, and passive sharers who listen on their own and share asynchronously. Those who 
preferred asynchronous sharing were generally not against real-time share features but indicated that they must be able to be turned on or off. 
(There were also a couple of outlier participants who were entirely disinterested in sharing music. These outlying individuals will likely not be 
included in our target audience.) Regardless of the method used to share music, it was almost entirely reported as a bonding experience. In our 
next milestone, we will use the information we now have about user demographics, devices, priorities, likes, and dislikes to craft personas we 
believe will accurately reflect our target audience.
