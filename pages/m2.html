        <h2>Contextual Inquiry Process</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to explore a playful musical application that supports both positive and meaningful social interactions between young adults. Over the course of the semester, we will research potential features that augment the human experience and create a prototype showcasing them. Possible features may involve group music curation, soundtracks based on biometric data, and networking based on shared tastes. The process will involve user research, creating personas, and designing both low and high fidelity prototypes to be tested by the target audience.</p>

    <h2>Interview Guide</h2>
    <p>The following questions were used for our contextual inquiry interviews:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Demographic Information</dt>
      <dd>- Members will attend meetings on time and be active contributors to the topic at hand.<br/>
       - Members will inform colleagues if it is necessary to miss a meeting 24 hours in advance, excepting medical or familial emergencies.<br/>
       - If a meeting is missed, the absent member should follow-up with the team as soon as possible.</dd>
      <dt>Social Media Usage</dt>
      <dd>- Members are expected to communicate regularly, as their schedules allow.</dd>
      <dt>Music Consumption & Sharing</dt>
      <dd>- Members are expected to contribute to each step of the project process, though it is also expected that there may be areas of strengths and weaknesses. This is okay. <br/>
       - Members should seek to improve their weak areas and emphasize their strengths. Work should be divided as equitably as possible. <br/>
       - If a member is struggling to fulfill a project need, they should reach out early on instead of waiting until the last minute to seek help.</dd>
