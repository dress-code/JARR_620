        <h2>Contextual Inquiry Process</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to explore a playful musical application that supports both positive and meaningful social interactions between young adults. Over the course of the semester, we will research potential features that augment the human experience and create a prototype showcasing them. Possible features may involve group music curation, soundtracks based on biometric data, and networking based on shared tastes. The process will involve user research, creating personas, and designing both low and high fidelity prototypes to be tested by the target audience.</p>

    <h2>Interview Guide</h2>

          - What devices do you mainly use to get on social media? <br/>
      </dd>
      <dt>Social Media Usage</dt>
      <dd>- What current social media apps do you use? <br/>
          - What do you like about them? What do you dislike about them? <br/>

          - Would you enjoy a music streaming platform that connects you with people of similar music tastes? <br/>
          - How do you find and choose new music to listen to? (If they need help, prompt with “Friends suggestions? Application suggestions? Radio?”)<br/>
          - Would you be interested in connecting with new people with similar music tastes as you? Or just with friends you already know?
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>We also gave our participants a few scenarios to gage their interest in some potential features.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Scenario 1</dt>
      <dd>You are at a coffee shop listening to the music on your phone on an application that fosters music sharing. There is a cute person across the room, but they have headphones on. You can see on the app that they are listening to a song from a genre you like. After a little while, you get a notification that someone has a song suggestion for you. You open it up to see the cute person’s profile picture next to the title of a song. You can accept or decline it. In this case, you accept. After listening to the song, a chat window appears for you to optionally start a conversation or give feedback about their suggestion.<br/> 

Assuming you have the ability to turn this feature on and off, would you or any of your friends enjoy sharing music in this way? Why or why not?
