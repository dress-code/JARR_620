        <h2>Developing Personas</h2>
	    <p>Together, team members followed the process outlined by Alan Cooper for developing personas. 
From our affinity diagram produced in <a href="./m2.html">milestone two</a>, participants were mapped along axes representing core functionality, desires, and dislikes. 
We were able to discern primary and secondary personas we believe represent the population we are designing for, as well as an 
anti-persona to help prevent us from getting lost in details about people outside the target user base.</p>

					<dd>Alexandra is a melophile. That is, she absolutely loves music and <strong>discovering songs
					that fit her unique tastes</strong>. Because her musical preferences tend to be more niche, it 
					can be hard for her to <strong>meet other people who enjoy the same musicians</strong>. She believes “music 
					bonds people” and <strong>wants to experience new music or old favorites simultaneously with those she 
					cares about</strong>, whether together in the same room or 3,000 miles apart.</dd>
					<dt>Scenario</dt>

					<dd>After getting back to her apartment from her on-campus job at the coffee shop, Alexandra wants to share 
					a new song that she heard on the indie radio station while at work. She hops onto a web application on her latop and 
					invites friends to join a “studio” room. In this space, she and her friends can simultaneously search for, 
					add, and listen to songs together— including the new one she is eager to share. She makes the room publicly 
					viewable so that anyone can join if they are interested, which will allow her to meet new people.</dd>

					<dd>In between classes in her packed schedule, Caroline loves to <strong>listen to popular music</strong>. She enjoys <strong>finding 
					newly released songs from her favorite pop artists</strong>. Caroline shares similar music tastes with a large population, 
					and often finds herself connecting with new people over music she’s heard recently. Due to her busy lifestyle, she 
					enjoys <strong>sharing and receiving song suggestions from friends on her own time.</strong></dd>

					<dt>Scenario</dt>
					<dd>After recently leaving her hometown to attend her first year of college, Caroline misses her little brother, Liam, 
					back home. Her busy schedule makes it difficult for them to find time when they are both free to chat. On her walk back 
					to her dorm after class, she starts listening to music on her iPhone. After hearing a song that reminds her of Liam, she 
					opens the application’s messaging system to share it with him along with a note expressing that she can’t wait to visit 
					soon. </dd>
