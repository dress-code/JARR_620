        <h2>Developing Personas</h2>
	    <p>Together, team members followed the process outlined by Alan Cooper for developing personas. 
From our affinity diagram produced in <a href="./m2.html">milestone two</a>, participants were mapped along axes representing core functionality, desires, and dislikes. 
We were able to discern primary and secondary personas we believe generally represent our user base, as well as an 
anti-persona to help prevent us from getting lost in details about people outside the target user base.</p>

					<dt>Goals</dt>
					<dd>Alexandra is a melophile. That is, she absolutely loves music and <strong>discovering songs
					that fit her unique tastes</strong>. Because her musical preferences tend to be more niche, it 
					can be hard for her to <strong>meet other people who enjoy the same musicians</strong>. She believes “music 
					bonds people” and <strong>wants to experience new music or old favorites simultaneously with those she 
					cares about</strong>, whether together in the same room or 3,000 miles apart.</dd>
					<dt>Scenario</dt>
					<dd>After getting back to her apartment from her on-campus job at the coffee shop, Alexandra wants to share 
					a new song that she heard on the indie radio station while at work. She hops onto an app on her iPhone and 
					invites friends to join a “studio” room. In this space, she and her friends can simultaneously search for, 
					add, and listen to songs together— including the new one she is eager to share. She makes the room publicly 
					viewable so that new people can join if they are interested.</dd>
