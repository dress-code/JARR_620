  <!-- Section defining project scope -->

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to explore a playful musical application that supports both positive and meaningful social interactions between young adults. Over the course of the semester, we will research potential features that augment the human experience and create a prototype showcasing them. Possible features may involve group music curation, soundtracks based on biometric data, and networking based on shared tastes. The process will involve user research, creating personas, and designing both low and high fidelity prototypes to be tested by the target audience.</p>

        <h2>General Approach</h2>
        <p>The first step to our approach was to identify a problem statement. We brainstormed various ideas for problems we could solve in our domain of social media. One of the things we noted in our discussion is that many applications in this domain have become mires of negativity and unhealthy comparison. We also believe that music is a positive experience for most people, as it provides a therapeutic retreat from the stresses of life or enables one to ruminate on emotions. From these realizations, we decided to move in the direction of designing a social media application that facilitates positive interaction and sharing based on music.</p>
        <p> At present, we are in the process of solidifying who all of our stakeholders will be for this project. So far, we have discussed and included those listed in the above section. The next step in our plan is to conduct a contextual inquiry. We will perform research on potential features based on the desires and habits of musical listeners, especially as it relates to sharing music with others. We plan to glean this information mainly through surveys, interviews, and other forms of user-research that are COVID-friendly. From this data, we will develop an affinity diagram, and create personas that capture our user base. </p>
        <p> Next, we will design prototypes of our application, starting with low-fidelity iterations. A high-fidelity, interactive prototype will be the final product. This will be tested by representatives of our user base to determine whether the experience is pleasant, useful, and fulfilling. As a team, we will be dividing work based on our strengths. Throughout the process, we will be constantly evaluating and revising our work to ensure that valuable, quality deliverables are presented to our stakeholders. </p>
